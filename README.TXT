THIS IS THE README FOR OUR USWS PROJECT IN 18/19 WiSe
CREATORS: LUCAS OLDENBURG, MAXIMILIAN BENZ AND TAHIR OEGEL


TO START THE APPLICATION:
--> GO TO THE SOURCES FOLDER
    --> RUN THE FILE "APP.py"
        --> THE LINK WHICH IS OUTPUTED IN THE CONSOLE WILL REDIRECT YOU TO THE LOCALHOST

- THE ALGORITHM IS PLACED ON THE CODE_V4_3.py FILE (INSIDE IT YOU CAN FIND ALL THE MAIN FUNCTIONS)

- THE FRONTEND IS PLACED IN "TEMPLATES" & "STATIC" FOLDERS

- TO TEST WITH OUR TEST DATA SET YOU NEED TO RUN THE "TEST" FUNCTION IN THE code_v4_3.py FILE
    --> JUST UNCOMMENT THE FUNCTION AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE AND RUN THE WHOLE FILE

- "Filling_Features.py" prepares the dataframes for machine learning, splits them into train- and test-data and exports them as .csv


- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU MAYBE HAVE TO EDIT SOME PATHS IN THE CODE IF A ERROR APPEARS


- "YELP_SCRAPER.PY" --> SCRAPES YELP FOR DATA WHICH IS PUTTED IN OUR MONGODB DATABASE AND THEN EXPORTED TO CSV TO MAKE USE OF "FILLING_FEATURES.PY"
